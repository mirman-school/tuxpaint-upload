# Tux Paint Upload

For easy uploading of images to Tux Paint.

## How to Use

Go grab the `.app` from the [releases page](https://github.com/mirman-school/tuxpaint-upload/releases/latest), which you can then copy into your `/Applications` folder. From there, move the app to your Dock. You can then drag files or folders with images in them over the icon. Those images will be moved easily to your `starters` folder for Tux Paint!

## Why we made this

Our students love Tux Paint, but they wanted an easy way to customize it. This lets all students simply add backgrounds to color. We use this app with students as young as 5 years old.
